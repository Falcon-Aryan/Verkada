File Replacement Code

You will have to change the paths of all "devicePath" and "oldFile" variables to whatever your device shows when all book videos are plugged in.

You will also have to change the path of every shutil.copy() command to wherever you copy the new videos over. (newFile1 and newFile2 do not work)
